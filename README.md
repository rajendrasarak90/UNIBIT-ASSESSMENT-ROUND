# Array Combinations

This repository contains the code for the assessment task assigned by UNIBIT PRIVATE LIMITED. The task involves finding combinations of integers in an array that sum up to a given target value, merging the combinations into a single sorted array, and then finding combinations in the merged array that sum up to a double target value.

## Task Details

- Given an array of integers and a target value, the code must determine which two integers' sum equals the target and return a 2D array.
- The array is then merged into a single array in ascending order.
- The target value is doubled, and combinations of digits in the merged array that sum up to the double target value are found and returned as a 2D array.

## Getting Started

To run the code and perform the task, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command: `git clone https://github.com/rajendrasarak90/UNIBIT-ASSESSMENT-ROUND.git`
2. Make sure you have Java installed on your machine.
3. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.
4. Run the ArrayCombinations.java file.
5. Follow the prompts to enter the size of the array, the elements of the array, and the target value.
6. The code will find the combinations, merge the array, and find the combinations for the double target value. The results will be displayed in the console.

## Files and Functions

1. ArrayCombinations.java: The main Java file that contains the implementation of the task.
2. findCombinations(): Function to find combinations of integers that sum up to the target value.
3. mergeArray(): Function to merge the combinations into a single sorted array.
4. findCombinationsDouble(): Function to find combinations of digits in the merged array that sum up to the double target value.
5. printArray(): Utility function to print 2D and 1D arrays in a formatted manner.
